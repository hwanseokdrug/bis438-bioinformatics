In this project, we will predict the toxicity of compounds using a neural network model (Mayr, Andreas, et al. "DeepTox: toxicity prediction using deep learning." Frontiers in Environmental Science 3 (2016): 80.). 

The given datasets are 'nr-ar.smiles' and 'nr-er.smiles' file. 

Each file contains 'smiles string of compound', 'array data', and 'activity value' (toxicity) at each raw. 

Activity value is marked as 0 when a compound is non-toxic, and 1 vice versa. 

We will use RDKit and Keras (tensorflow backend) package to build a prediction model. 

RDKit is the most widely used python package for handling chemical compounds. 

Keras is one of famous packages for the neural network.

A pseudo code (project1_pseudo_cod.py) is also provided (you can use this code or make your own code from scratch)

1) you need to build a neural network model for predicting the toxicity of compounds.
2) Train your model using the training dataset (and optimize your model using validation set).
3) Report the ROC-AUC score of the test dataset using the trained model.
4) Use google colab (or whatever you want)
5) Upload  jupyter notebook (".ipynb" file) or link to your google colab code
